about.html — Your About Page
================================================================================

This is a secondary page. It shares the same CSS file as index.html, which means
it automatically has the same styling. The header and footer are duplicated here
to keep navigation consistent across pages.

In larger projects, you'd use templates or includes to avoid this duplication.
For now, if you change the header in one file, remember to change it in the other.
